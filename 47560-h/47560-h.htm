      INTRODUCTORY NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When, during the season of 1885, the exceptional success of "The
      Magistrate" had revived the fortunes of the Court Theatre and included
      that house once again among the popular places of entertainment, the
      future policy of Messrs. John Clayton and Arthur Cecil's management was
      practically determined. The essentially comic play, the farce of character
      and manners, was henceforth to compose the programme, and Mr. Pinero, who
      had suggested the new policy, and so happily inaugurated it, was naturally
      commissioned to provide the next play. "The Schoolmistress" was
      accordingly forthcoming in due time, and in the composition of this piece
      the author further developed his ideas as to the scope and meaning of
      modern farce, ideas which will be found briefly expounded in my
      introductory note to "The Cabinet Minister," published in the present
      series of Mr. Pinero's plays. "The Schoolmistress" has a very simple
      stage-history. It was produced at the old Court Theatre on March 27, 1886,
      and it immediately caught the laughter and applause of the town, the
      success being so decided that the play retained its place in the programme
      until January 22, 1887, the total number of performances in the interval
      having amounted to 290.
    </p>
    <p>
      For purposes of reference a copy of the "first night" programme is here
      appended:

      The success in London led to the Court management sending a special
      company to represent the play in the provinces, where its popularity has
      been great and enduring, so much so that Mr. Edward Terry has recently
      added "The Schoolmistress" to his provincial repertoire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same story of success must be told of the play's career in Australia
      and America. Messrs. Brough and Boucicault presented it to the audiences
      of the Antipodes, where, in the character of Peggy Hesslerigge, Miss
      Pattie Browne is said to have given a remarkable performance, as the
      original exponent of the part, Miss Norreys, had done in London. In the
      United States, Miss Rosina Vokes was responsible for the production of Mr.
      Pinero's play, but there the principal success was achieved by Mr. Weedon
      Grossmith in the character of the Hon. Vere Queckett, originally
      interpreted with so much quaint humour by Mr. Arthur Cecil.

      THE FIRST ACT&mdash;THE MYSTERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The Scene is the Reception Room at Miss Dyott's seminary for young
      ladies, known as Volumnia College, Volumnia House, near Portland Place.
      The windows look on to the street, and a large door at the further end of
      the room opens to the hall, where there are some portmanteaus standing,
      while there is another door on the spectator's right. Jane Chipman, a
      stout, middle-aged servant, and Tyler, an unhealthy looking youth, wearing
      a page's jacket, enter the room, carrying between them a large
      travelling-trunk.</i>
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Breathlessly.</i>] 'Old 'ard&mdash;'old 'ard! Phew! [<i>They rest the
      trunk on the floor, Tyler dabs his forehead with a small dirty
      handkerchief, which he passes on to Jane.</i>] Excuse me not offering it
      to you first, Jane.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Dabbing the palms of her hands.</i>] Don't name it, Tyler. Do you
      'appen to know what time Missus starts?
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Two-thirty, I 'eard say.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      It's a queer thing her going away like this alone&mdash;not to say nothing
      of a schoolmistress leaving a lot of foolish young gals for a month or six
      weeks.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Sitting despondently on the trunk.</i>] Cook and the parlourmaid got
      rid of too&mdash;it's not much of a Christmas vacation we shall get, you
      and me, Jane.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      You're right. [<i>Sitting on the sofa.</i>] Let's see&mdash;how many of
      our young ladies 'aven't gone home for their 'olidays?
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Well, there's Miss 'Awkins.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Her people is in India.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Miss Johnson.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Her people is in the Divorce Court.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Miss Hesslerigge.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, she ain't got no 'ome. She's a orphan, studying for to be a governess.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then there's this new girl, Miss Ranklin'.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Dinah Ranklin'?
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, Dinah Ranklin'. Now why is <i>she</i> to spend her Exmas at our
      College? She's the daughter of Admiral Ranklin', and the Ranklin's live
      jest round the corner at Collin'wood 'Ouse.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, she's been failin' in love or something, and has got to be locked up.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Well then, last but not least, there's the individual who is kicking his
      'eels about the 'ouse, and giving himself the airs of the 'aughty.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Mysteriously.</i>] What&mdash;Missus's husband?
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;Missus's husband.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah! Mark my word, if ever there was a mystery, there's one.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      <i>Who</i> is he? Missus brings him 'ome about a month ago, and doesn't
      introduce him to us or to nobody. The order is she's still to be called
      Miss Dyott, and we don't know even his nasty name.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Returning to the trunk.</i>] She calls him Ducky.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, but <i>we</i> can't call him Ducky. [<i>Pointing to the handkerchief
      which Jane has left upon the sofa</i>] My 'andkerchief, please. I don't
      let <i>anybody</i> use it.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Returning the handkerchief.</i>] Excuse me. [<i>In putting the
      handkerchief into his breast-pocket he first removes a handful of
      cheap-looking squibs.</i>] Lor! You will carry them deadly fireworks about
      with you, Tyler.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Regarding them fondly.</i>] Fireworks is my only disserpation. There
      ain't much danger unless anybody lunges at me. [<i>Producing some dirty
      crackers from his trousers pockets, and regarding them with gloomy relish.</i>]
      Friction is the risk I run.
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Palpitating.</i>] Oh, don't, Tyler! How can you 'ave such a 'ankering?
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Intensely.</i>] It's more than a 'ankering. I love to 'oard 'em and
      meller 'em. To-day they're damp&mdash;to-morrow they're dry. And when the
      time comes for to let them off&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then they don't go off&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Putting the fireworks away.</i>] P'r'aps not&mdash;and it's their
      'orrible uncertainty wot I crave after. Lift your end, Jane. [<i>They take
      up the trunk as Gwendoline Hawkins and Ermyntrude Johnson, two pretty
      girls, the one gushing, the other haughty in manner, appear in the hall.</i>]
    </p>
    <h5>
      GWENDOLINE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Here are Miss Dyott's boxes&mdash;she is really going to-day. I am so
      happy!
    </p>
    <h5>
      ERMYNTRUDE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      What an inexpressible relief! Oh, Tyler, I am dissatisfied with the manner
      in which my shoes are polished.
    </p>
    <h5>
      GWENDOLINE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;and, Tyler, you never fed my mice last night.
    </p>
    <h5>
      TYLER.
    </h5>
    <p>
      It ain't my place. Birds and mice is Jane's place.

      Don't shake him, Miss, don't shake him! [<i>Peggy Hesslerigge enters
      through the hall, and comes between Tyler and Gwendoline. Peggy is a
      shabbily dressed, untidy girl, with wild hair and inky fingers, her voice
      is rather shrewish and her actions are jerky: altogether she has the
      appearance of an overwise and neglected child.</i>].

    <h5>

      Go away, Tyler. [<i>Tyler and Jane deposit the trunk in the hall with the

    <p>
      Ugh! Haven't we sworn to help Dinah Rankling with our last breath? Haven't
      we sworn to free her from the chains of tyranny and oppression, and never
      to eat much till we have seen her safely and happily by her husband's
      side!
    </p>
    <h5>

      We can&mdash;we've got to. If Dinah's husband is ever to enter this house

    <p>
      He is much my senior&mdash;he was seventeen in November. Well, the
      following week Reginald proposed to me in the conservatory. He spoke very
      sensibly about settling down, and how we were not growing younger; and how
      he'd seen a house in Park Lane which wasn't to let, but which very likely
      would be to let some day. And then we went into the drawing-room and told
      Mamma.
    </p>
    <h5>

    <p>
      Mamma, who is very delicate, went into violent hysterics and tore at the
      hearthrug with her teeth. But a day or two afterwards she grew a little
      calmer, and promised to write to Papa, who was with his ship at Malta.
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      And did she?
    </p>
    <h5>
      DINAH.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes. Papa, you know, is Admiral Rankling. His ship, the "Pandora," has
      never run into anything, and so Papa is a very distinguished man.
    </p>
    <h5>

      And what was his answer?
    </p>
    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      He telegraphed home one terrible word&mdash;"Bosh!"

    </h5>
    <p>
      The telegraphic rate from Malta necessitates abruptness, but I can never
      forgive the choice of such a phrase. But it decided our fate. Three weeks
      ago, when I was supposed to be selecting wools at Whiteley's, Reginald and
      I were secretly united at the Registry Office.
    </p>
    <h5>
      GWENDOLINE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, how lovely!

    <p>
      How romantic!
    </p>
    <h5>
      DINAH.
    </h5>
    <p>
      We declared we were much older than we really are, but, as Reginald said,
      trouble had aged us, so it wasn't a story. At the doors of the Registry
      Office we parted.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ERMYNTRUDE.

      I couldn't have done that!
    </p>
    <h5>
      DINAH.
    </h5>
    <p>
      And when I reached home there was a letter from Papa ordering Mamma to
      have me locked up at once in a Boarding School; and here I am&mdash;torn
      from my husband, my letters opened by Miss Dyott, quite friendless and
      alone.

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      No, that you're not, Dinah. Listen to me! Miss Dyott is going out of town
      to-day, and I'm left in charge. I'm a poor governess, but playing jailer
      over bleeding hearts is not in my articles, and if your husband comes to
      Volumnia House and demands his wife, he doesn't go away without you&mdash;does
      he, young ladies?

      I am married secretly&mdash;secretly, because my husband could never face

      It had been a long-cherished ambition with me, if ever I married, to wed
      no one but a gentleman. I do not mean a gentleman in a mere parliamentary

      [<i>With pride.</i>] Certainly. So is Harold Archideckne Queckett, Vere's
      youngest brother. So is Loftus Martineau Queckett, Vere's cousin. They
      have always been a very united family. But, dear Mr. Bernstein, you have
      accidentally probed the one&mdash;I won't say fault&mdash;the one most
      remarkable attribute of these great Saxon Quecketts.

      Quite so&mdash;that is it. I have the honour of being employed in the
      gradual discharge of liabilities incurred by Mr. Vere Queckett since the

    <p>
      In the stalls&mdash;at the theatre! Hush, Mr. Bernstein, it is a secret
      from Vere. Lest his suspicions should be aroused by my leaving home every
      evening, I have led him to think that I am visiting a clergyman's wife at
      Hereford. I shall really be lodging in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden.
    </p>
    <h5>
      BERNSTEIN.
    </h5>

      Oh, vy not tell him all about it?
    </p>
    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Nonsense! Vere is a gentleman; he would insist upon attending me to and
      from the theatre.

      No&mdash;no. He is himself a graceful dancer. A common chord of sympathy
      would naturally be struck between him and the <i>coryphées</i>. Oh, there
      is so much variety in Vere's character.

      Happy! Think of the deception I am practising upon dear Vere! Think of the
      people who believe in the rigid austerity of Caroline Dyott, Principal of
      Volumnia College. Think of the precious confidence reposed in me by the
      parents and relations of twenty-seven innocent pupils. Give an average of
      eight and a half relations to each pupil; multiply eight and a half by
      twenty-seven and you approximate the number whose trust I betray this

      The Admiral has one of those fine English tempers&mdash;generous but
      impetuous. You may guess the sad impression Dinah's ingratitude has
      produced upon him. It is an open secret that the Admiral made three wills
      yesterday, and read King Lear's curse after supper in place of
      Thanksgiving.

      Queckett. [<i>He starts.</i>] We ladies are going to give a little party
      to-night to celebrate a serious event in the life of one of us. We have
      invited only one young gentleman; your friends will be welcome.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh!
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Without us your party must fail, for we command the servants. Let it be a
      compact&mdash;your soirée shall be our soirée, and our soirée your soirée.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      And if I indignantly decline?
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Solemnly.</i>] Consider, Mr. Queckett&mdash;your Christmas holidays
      are to be passed with us. Think in which direction your comfort and
      freedom lie&mdash;in friendship or in enmity? Even now, Ermyntrude Johnson
      is trimming the holly with one of your razors.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      But what explanation could I give Mr. Mallory of your presence here?
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Every detail has been considered. You are our bachelor uncle.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Uncle!
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      We are your four nieces.

    <p>
      [<i>Queckett looks up&mdash;is tickled by the idea, and bursts out
      laughing. Peggy joins.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't see why that shouldn't be rather jolly.
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Roguishly.</i>] D'ye consent?
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Can't help myself&mdash;can I?
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [Delighted] That you can't.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Let's be friends, then&mdash;shall we? Have you girls got any money?
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      No. Have you?
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      No! that is, all mine's invested.

    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT.

    <h5>
      PEGGY.

    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Still in your overcoat, dear?
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Of course, Carrie. I'll drive with you to Paddington.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      No, no&mdash;I insist on going alone.

      QUECKETT.

    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Dinah, Gwendoline, and Ermyntrude come through the hall, into the
      room, and form a group. Jane enters the hall. Tyler joins her there.</i>]

    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Miss Hesslerigge&mdash;young ladies. I regret to say I am compelled to&mdash;to
      quit Volumnia House for a time. The length of my absence depends upon how
      long it runs&mdash;[<i>correcting herself in confusion</i>]&mdash;upon how
      long it runs to it, to employ a colloquialism of the vulgar. But I depart
      with a light heart, because I leave my husband in authority. He will find
      a trusty lieutenant in Miss Hesslerigge. Ladies, to abandon for the moment
      our mother tongue, <i>Je vous embrasse de tout mon cour&mdash;soyez sages!</i>
    </p>
    <h5>
      GIRLS.

    <p>
      [<i>Together.</i>] Au revoir, Mademoiselle Dyott! Bon voyage, Mademoiselle
      Dyott! [<i>Peggy joins the Girls and they talk earnestly. A Cabman is seen
      carrying out the boxes from the hall, assisted by Tyler. Miss Dyott
      produces some paper packets of money from her hand-bag.</i>]

    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>As she gives the packets to Queckett.</i>] Vere, the house-agent will
      apply for the rent&mdash;there it is. Our fire insurance expired yesterday&mdash;post
      the premium to the Eagle Office at once. Jane's wages are due next week&mdash;deduct
      for the broken water bottle. When you need exercise, dear one, tidy up the
      back yard&mdash;the recreation ground. A charwoman assists Jane on Fridays&mdash;three

      THE SECOND ACT
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The scene is a plain-looking schoolroom t Miss Dyott's. Outside the two
      windows runs a narrow balcony, and beyond are seen the upper stories and
      roofs of the opposite houses. There are two doors facing each other. The
      room is decorated for the occasion with holly and evergreen, and a table
      is laid with supper. Peggy is standing on a chair, with a large hammer in
      her hand, nailing up holly.</i>
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Surveying her work.</i>] There! I'm sure Miss Dyott wouldn't recognise
      the dull old class-rooms. [<i>Descending.</i>] I think it's time I
      dressed. [<i>Queckett enters slowly; he is in a perfectly fitting evening
      dress, with a flower in his button-hole, but looks much depressed. He and
      Peggy regard each other for a moment silently.</i>] Oh, I'm so glad you're
      ready early! How good it makes one feel, giving pleasure to others&mdash;doesn't
      it? Aren't you well?
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;no. I deeply regret plunging into the vortex of these
      festivities.
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, I suppose you're nervous in society.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Drawing himself up!</i>] Nervous in society, Miss Hesslerigge?
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      What do you think of the decorations? Artistic, aren't they?
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      A treat at a Sunday School!
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then you shouldn't have locked up the rooms downstairs.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I daren't allow the neighbours to see the house lighted up downstairs. I

    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      That's not the spirit to give a party in! [<i>Contemplating the table.</i>]
      How many do you think your friend, Mr. Mallory, will bring?
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I don't think Mr. Mallory will find his way here at all. Have you observed
      the fog?
    </p>
    <h5>

    <p>
      Is it foggy?

      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I beg your pardon. Who <i>is</i> Paulover? [<i>Tyler enters with a bill
      in-his hand, with his hair stiffly brushed and greased, and wearing an

      TYLER.

    <p>
      A beautiful large lobster salid is come, sir.

    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Looking at Peggy.</i>] I haven't ordered a lobster salad. [<i>In an
      undertone.</i>] You know, this is getting extremely vexing. [<i>He takes
      from his pocket the packets of money previously given him by Miss Dyott.</i>]
      I've already paid a bill for some oysters and a <i>pâté de foie gras</i>.
      Jane's wages went for that. [<i>Opening a packet.</i>] Now, here's a
      salad. That breaks into next week's household expenses. [<i>Handing the
      money to Tyler, who goes out.</i>]
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      We're only girls, you know. And you seem to forget you're our uncle.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Irritably.</i>] I am <i>not</i> your uncle.
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      To-night you are. But you needn't be our uncle to-morrow.

    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Gloomily.</i>] Somebody will have to be <i>my</i> uncle to-morrow.
      Then I understand there's a lark pudding ordered for half-past nine. I
      can't allow the account to be sent in to&mdash;to&mdash;

      It may be our lark&mdash;but it's your pudding. [<i>Tyler enters still

    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Part of the party is my party. [<i>Opening another packet.</i>] I've
      broken into the rent. [<i>He hands Tyler the bill and some money,
      pocketing the remainder. Tyler goes out.</i>] The Fire Insurance alone
      remains intact. [<i>Opening the last packet.</i>] Postal Orders for thirty
      shillings. I'll despatch that, at any rate. [<i>He sits at the
      writing-table and begins to write. Peggy hammers up the last piece of
      holly, as Queckett tries to write.</i>] Oh, you vexing girl!

    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Beg pardon; this is the last blow. [<i>She gives another knock as Jane
      enters, carrying a large ornamental wedding-cake. Jane is in a black gown

    <p>
      Your niece&mdash;Dinah Rankling.

      <i>Young</i> Paulover. They were married really three weeks ago, but
      without any breakfast&mdash;I don't mean a bacon breakfast, I mean a
      proper breakfast. But we girls think they ought to have a wedding-cake and
      everything complete to start them in life together: and that's why you're
      giving this party, you know.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Now, understand me, I will not be dragged into such a conspiracy!

    <p>
      But you're in it.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      The Ranklings are acquaintances of mine, almost relatives; Admiral
      Rankling's cousin married the sister of the man who bought my brother's
      horses. [<i>Rubbing his hands together.</i>] I wash my hands of all you
      vexing girls.

      won't you? [<i>She goes out. Jane enters with tarts and confectionery on
      dishes which she places on the table before Queckett.</i>]

    <h5>
      JANE.

      They won't let me write to the Insurance Office. [<i>Tyler enters with
      some boxes of bon-bons. The writing table being crowded Jane waves him

    <p>
      <i>The scene is a well-furnished, tastefully decorated morning-room in the
      house of Admiral Rankling. At the further end of the room there are two
      double doors facing each other, one with glazed panels opening to a
      conservatory, the other to a dark room. There are also two doors near to
      the pillars that support an archway spanning the room. All is darkness
      save for a faint glow from the fire, and a blue light coming through the
      conservatory windows.</i>

    <p>
      [<i>In a whisper.</i>] Where have I got to now, I wonder? What a dreadful
      wilderness of a house to wander about in, in the dark, all alone. Oh, for
      the daylight! [<i>Looking at her watch.</i>] Half-past six. Why, gracious!
      here's a spark of fire! Oh, joy! [<i>She goes down on her knees, and
      replenishes the fire with coal from the scuttle. The door opens, and
      Gwendoline peeps in.</i>]

    <h5>
      GWENDOLINE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>In a whisper.</i>] What room is this? [<i>Entering noiselessly.</i>]
      Will the day never break? [<i>Frightened, and retreating as Peggy makes a
      noise blowing up the fire.</i>] Oh!

    <h5>

    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Shivering.</i>] Sleep? no. As if I could sleep in a strange bed in a
      strange house, in one of Admiral Rankling's night-gowns. You didn't meet
      any daylight on the stairs, did you? [<i>Another door opens, and
      Ermyntrude enters noiselessly.</i>]

    <p>
      I thought I saw a glimmer through the window on the first floor landing.

    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, perhaps that's some of yesterday's. I know! I've made up the fire; let
      us bivouac here till daybreak. Two by the fire, and take it in turns for
      the sofa. [<i>Picking up a bearskin rug and carrying it to the sofa.</i>]
      Who's first for the sofa?

    </h5>
    <p>
      Come along, Gwendoline. [<i>Gwendoline puts herself upon the sofa, and
      Peggy covers her with the bearskin.</i>] There&mdash;as soon as you drop
      off to sleep it will be Ermyntrude's turn. [<i>Looking through the
      conservatory doors.</i>] Oh, how the snow is coming down! [<i>Joining
      Ermyntrude, who is warming her hands by the fire. She sits in an
      arm-chair.</i>]

    <p>
      Peggy&mdash;do you know what has become of poor Dinah?
    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, she's locked up up-stairs till the morning. Admiral Rankling locked
      her up.

    <h5>
      GWENDOLINE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>From the sofa.</i>] It's a shame!

    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Go to sleep! Oh, what a scene there was! Admiral Rankling foamed at the
      mouth. It was lucky they got Mr. Queckett away from him in time.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Of course he is&mdash;till the morning. Miss Dyott locked him up&mdash;very

    </p>
    <h5>
      SAUNDERS.

      from the conservatory windows upon her.</i>] Oh&mdash;what's that? [<i>Going
      softly up to Gwendoline, and looking at her.</i>] Why, here's my Gwen. I
      wonder if she'd mind my sitting near her. [<i>Turning up his coat collar
      and sitting gently on the footstool, he leans against the head of the sofa
      drowsily.</i>] Now if any robbers wanted to hurt Gwen, I could kill them.
      [<i>Closing his eyes wearily.</i>] Oh! [<i>Soon there is a sound of heavy
      regular breathing from the four sleeping figures. The door opens, and

      [<i>Shivering.</i>] Can't get a blessed wink of sleep. Where have I

      Gwendoline.</i>] Hallo, here's one of those schoolgirls&mdash;[<i>discovering
      Saunders</i>] and&mdash;well, this nephew of mine is a devil of a fellow!
      That isn't a glimmer of fire, surely. [<i> Walking towards the fireplace
      he nearly stumbles over Ermyntrude.</i>] More girls! [<i>He accidentally
      knocks over the scuttle. They all wake with a start.</i>]

    </h5>
    <p>
      Perhaps not; but Admiral Rankling asked me to remain, and, if he hadn't,
      I'm not going to leave this house till my friend Queckett is out of
      danger.

    <p>
      Hesslerigge and you wish you'd never been born. [<i> Taking her hand.</i>]
      Well, Miss Hesslerigge, the serious aspect of the affair is that Admiral

    </p>
    <h5>
      PEGGY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Tearfully.</i>] I know. I've never seen a gentleman foam at the mouth

      the milkman never come to Portland Place? I have been listening at the
      keyhole of Vere's room&mdash;not a sound. He can sleep with the ruin of
      Volumnia College upon his conscience while I&mdash;[<i>sinking into a

      her.</i>] Caroline! Scylla and Charybdis! [<i>He bolts back into the dark

      I heard something fall. [<i>Seeing Miss Dyott.</i>] Mrs. Queckett! [<i>Distantly.</i>]
      Instructions were given that everybody should be called at eight. I had
      arranged that a more appropriate costume should be placed at your
      disposal. [<i>Seeing the broken bust.</i>] Ah, what has happened?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT.

    <p>
      Well, if you didn't know your own daughter was married how can you wonder

    <h5>

    <h5>

      It is the same as your own&mdash;an undervalued wife. Let me open your

      Sit down. [<i>Queckett sits promptly.</i>] As an old friend of your

    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, you don't. Very well, then. [<i>Drawing his chair still nearer

    <p>
      [<i>Clutching Queckett's knee.</i>] He's Deputy Inspector of Prisons in
      British Guiana, you know. Doesn't have time to write often, does he?
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Admiral Rankling, you will permit me to remind you that in families of
      long standing and complicated interests there are regrettable
      estrangements which should be lightly dealt with. [<i>Affected.</i>] You
      have recalled memories. [<i>Rising.</i>] Excuse me.
    </p>
    <h5>
      RANKLING.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Rising.</i>] No sir, I will not excuse you!
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Where are my gloves?
    </p>
    <h5>
      RANKLING.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Because, Mr. Queckett, I have your assurance as a gentleman that your
      brother Tankerville's daughter is married to a charming young fellow of
      the name of Parkinson. Now I've discovered that Parkinson is really a
      charming young fellow of the name of Paulover, so that, as Paulover has
      married my daughter as well as Tankerville's, Paulover must be prosecuted
      for bigamy, and as you knew that Paulover was Parkinson, and Parkinson
      Paulover, you connived at the crime, inasmuch as knowing Paulover was
      Tankerville's daughter's husband you deliberately aided Parkinson in
      making my child Dinah his wife. But that's not the worst of it!
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh!
    </p>
    <h5>
      RANKLING.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Continuing, rapidly and excitedly.</i>] Because I have since received
      your gentlemanly assurance that Tankerville's daughter is my daughter.
      Now, either you mean to say that I've behaved like a blackguard to
      Tankerville&mdash;which will be a libel&mdash;or that Tankerville has
      conducted himself with less than common fairness to me&mdash;which will be
      a divorce. And, in either case, without wishing to anticipate the law, I
      shall personally chastise you, because, although I've been a sailor on the
      high seas for five and forty years, I have never during the whole of that
      period listened to such a yarn of mendacious fabrications as you spun me
      last night!
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.

    <p>
      [<i>Beginning to carefully put on his gloves.</i>] It would be idle to
      deny that this affair has now assumed its most unpleasant aspect. Admiral
      Rankling&mdash;the time has come for candour on both sides.
    </p>

    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I am being quick, Rankling. I admit, with all the rapidity of utterance of
      which I am capable, that my assurances of last night were founded upon an
      airy basis.
    </p>
    <h5>
      RANKLING.

    <p>
      In plain words&mdash;lies, Mr. Queckett.

    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      A habit of preparing election manifestos for various members of my family
      may have impaired a fervent admiration for truth, in which I yield to no
      man.
    </p>
    <h5>

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      I say, do so. But the triumph, when you kneel upon my body&mdash;for I am
      bound to tell you that I shall lie down&mdash;the triumph will be mine!
    </p>
    <h5>

      I went through the performance in a dream! The conductor's bâton beat
      nothing but, "Vere, Vere, Vere," into my eyes. Some one applauded me! I
      thought, "Ah, that's worth a new hat to Vere!" I sang my political verse&mdash;a
      man very properly hissed. "He has smashed Vere's new hat," I murmured. At
      last came my important solo. I drew a long breath, saw a vision of you
      reading an old copy of <i>The Rock</i>, by the fireside at home&mdash;and
      opened my mouth. I remembered nothing more till I found myself wildly
      dancing to the <i>refrain</i> of my song. The audience yelled with
      approbation&mdash;I bowed again and again&mdash;and then tottered away to
      sink into the arms of the prompter with the words, "Vere, catch your
      Carrie!"
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.

    <p>
      No&mdash;Vere Albany Bute Queckett; it isn't. The moment I dragged you
      down that ladder last night, and left behind me the smouldering ruins of
      Volumnia College, I became an altered woman.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then I will lay the whole affair before my family.
    </p>
    <h5>

    <p>
      Do, and tell them to what your selfishness has brought you&mdash;that
      where there was love there is disdain, where there was claret there will
      be beer, where there were cigars there will be pipes, and where there was
      Poole there will be Kino!

      I did not see dat&mdash;I will give dat to the gabman. Goo-bye&mdash;I
      cannot stay. I am going to have a Turkish bath till the evening babers
      gome out. I always say I do not read the evening babers&mdash;but I do! [<i>He

    <p>
      Mrs. Queckett, I shall book stalls at once to hear your singing.

      Stalls, Archibald.

      [<i> Glaring!</i>] Dress circle!

    <h5>
      MRS. RANKLING.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Stalls, Archibald, or I leave you for ever!
    </p>
    <h5>
      RANKLING.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Mildly.</i>] Very well, Emma. I have no desire but to please you.
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I take this as a great compliment, my dear Rankling. Carrie and I thank
      you. But I can't hear of it. I insist on offering you both a seat in my
      box.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      <i>Your</i> box!
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Softly to her.</i>] Hush! Carrie, my darling! Your Vere's private box!
    </p>
    <h5>
      MISS DVOTT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Queckett's private box, during my absence at night, will be our
      lodgings, where he will remain under lock and key. [<i>Peggy laughs at
      Queckett.</i>]
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.

    <p>
      [<i>To Peggy.</i>] Oh, you vexing girl!
    </p>
    <h5>
      MALLORY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>Annoyed.</i>] Excuse me, my dear Queckett&mdash;but while looking at
      the plants in the conservatory, I became engaged to Miss Hesslerigge. [<i>There
      is a general exclamation of surprise.</i>]
    </p>
    <h5>
      REGINALD.
    </h5>
    <p>
      [<i>To Mallory.</i>] Ah, coward, you haven't to wait five years! [<i>Jane
      enters.</i>]
    </p>
    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, if you please, ma'am, Tyler&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT, QUECKETT, PEGGY, AND DINAH.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Tyler!

    <h5>
      JANE.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Tyler wants to know who is to pay him the reward for being the first to
      fetch the fire engines last night?
    </p>
    <h5>
      QUECKETT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I will!
    </p>
    <h5>
      MISS DYOTT.
    </h5>
    <p>
      No&mdash;I will. Tyler has rendered me a signal service. He has demolished
      Volumnia College. From the ashes of that establishment rises the Phoenix
      of my new career. Miss Dyott is extinct&mdash;Miss Delaporte is alive,
      and, during the evening, kicking. I hope none will regret the change&mdash;I
      shall not, for one, while the generous public allow me to remain a
      Favourite!
